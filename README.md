# Python Library Suggester

Python have huge number of libraries, so for someone who is new to python and has less experience in python, it is sometimes tedious task for them to find which python library they can use for their project/model.

So this will provide them the most suitable library for their project, which will save time, efforts and will give a kick start to the project. 

Also, a project report will be generated containing the python library along with all the user inputs.

# Flow Chart of Methology 
User will give in the inputs and fill out the fields and when the inputs are fetched they are seached in an excel database and after a sucessful seach, a report will be generated containing the most suitable library along with the inputs.

# Technologies Used
1)Python

2)Flask

3)HTML

4)CSS

# Requiremnets and Future Scope
A table of libraries correctly mapped with the fields where the searching will happen and a prior knowledge of model is required and whenever the library table is updated, the content in the application is dynamically updated as well.
Coming to the future work, library reference documentation along with tools & technology can also be included.

# Project Goal
The goal is to provide user the most suitable python library for the project/model against the provided input by the user.
